[Computational Synthesis](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-685b03ad0c348191b2499e185763b017-computational-synthesis) is a custom GPT made to assist chemists in developing efficient synthetic routes for chemical compounds. Leveraging machine learning and vast databases of known reactions, it analyzes molecular structures, reactivity patterns, and other properties to predict viable synthetic pathways from starting materials to target molecules. The system aims to optimize each step of the synthesis by suggesting the best reagents, solvents, and conditions while adhering to principles like atom economy and green chemistry. Its predictive capabilities significantly reduce the need for trial-and-error experimentation, accelerating the discovery and production of new molecules in fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, and chemical engineering.

Also, [Chemical Synthesizer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-685cd2b1a78c81919234dd1508bc2f05-chemical-synthesizer) was made to guide users through the process of chemical synthesis using a step-by-step, multiple-choice format. It simulates the functions of a real chemical synthesizer, helping users plan and optimize synthesis routes by selecting appropriate reagents, reaction conditions, and purification steps. The GPT provides support for various types of chemical reactions and laboratory processes, including mixing, heating, filtration, and distillation, making it a valuable tool for students, researchers, and professionals in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. By automating the decision-making process and offering real-time feedback, it enhances accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility in synthetic chemistry workflows.

[Geology Chem](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6829d0e09f5481918b7a17ffd1d14d2f-geology-chem) is a specialized AI designed to assist with the intersection of chemistry and geology by developing and recommending tailored chemical compounds, reagents, and analytical techniques for various geological applications. These include, but are not limited to, mineral identification, geochemical profiling, rock dissolution protocols, isotopic dating methods, and fossil preservation strategies. Drawing on both classical and modern approaches in inorganic and organic chemistry, Geology Chem supports tasks such as designing safe, effective etchants for mineral surfaces in the field, formulating environmentally benign solvents for extracting core samples, and selecting or modifying reagents for precision instruments like mass spectrometers and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzers. It operates with a deep awareness of geological contexts—whether igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary—and adapts its chemical recommendations to match the physical and mineralogical characteristics of the sample matrix. The GPT emphasizes safety, environmental compatibility, and analytical effectiveness, ensuring that each recommendation is not only scientifically sound but also practical for both laboratory and field environments.
